This is a note, or log, or diary, of my software development experience.
It mainly records some high-level, programming-irrelevant discussion on software development.
The specific points, especially the technical details for software development, will be recorded in another post.

### Discussion: 2022-09-13 23:19:13 (UTC-7)

Today KW raised an idea to self-develop a project, and came up with a topic about developing a lightweighted netdist app.
It is expected to build a netdisk which supports small-range file sharing on Internet, online file management, etc.
More detailed description is expected to be provided in a seperate project-specific post.

XX proposed to develop a tool for managing variable correlation in academic paper in human resource management.
After discussion, we regarded this project worth of trying.
More detailed description is expected to be provided in another seperate project-specific post.
